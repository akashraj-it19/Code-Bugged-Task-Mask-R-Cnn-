# **Task :-**

Mask R-CNN is an object detection model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) developed by a group of Facebook AI researchers in 2017. The model can return both the bounding box and a mask for each detected object in an image. Prepare a google colab ipynb notebook to implement Mask Rcnn on the custom dataset.

# Mask-RCNN on a customized beagle dataset

There is a total number of 100 beagle images in the dataset which I scraped from Google Image. 75 images are used for training and 25 images are used for validation.

I used VGG Image Annotator to annotate the training and validation images.
